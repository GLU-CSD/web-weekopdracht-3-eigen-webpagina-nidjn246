   <div id="secondtext">The second movie was a big flop. It has a 2.4/10 on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31122323/">imdb</a> and i also didnt like it. They changed up the animation and the style of how the story is told. I give it a 3/10 because it just isnt it.</div>

    <img id="third" src="/assets/thirdpicture.png" alt="">
    <div id="thirdtext">The serie was even worse according to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18214172/">imdb</a>. Having a 2/10 star rating and being lower then the 2nd movie. I liked it more then the 2nd movie. I myself give it a 5/10 because it had a better story/watchlength</div>
